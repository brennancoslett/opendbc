# Pre-AP pedal accel envelopes, mapped to openpilot Driving Personality toggle.
# Breakpoints are speed in m/s; values are max accel in m/s².
# Based on Tinkla Pedal profiles but reduced for feedforward architecture:
# Tinkla uses PID which naturally dampens the ramp to the ceiling; our kf=1.0
# feedforward passes MPC targets straight through, so the ceilings must be
# lower to get the same feel.
#   aggressive(0) → spirited but controlled
#   standard(1)   → smooth daily driver
